Ryan ST-A for X-Plane 11, by FTLX Designs

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_ST):
The Ryan STs were a series of two seat, low-wing monoplane aircraft built in the United States by the Ryan Aeronautical Company. They were used as sport aircraft, as well as trainers by flying schools and the militaries of several countries.

The first Ryan ST flew for the first time on 8 June 1934 and production began the following year, when nine aircraft were delivered. Except for 1937 (when 46 aircraft were built), production rates remained low for several years, at about one aircraft every two weeks. This changed in 1940 when deliveries to military forces began in earnest; production that year was just under three aircraft per week. Total production of civil and military aircraft prior to the entry of the United States into World War II amounted to 315. Another 1,253 military versions were produced in 1942 and 1943, for a total of 1,568 aircraft of all models.

General characteristics (Ryan ST-A):

Crew: one
Capacity: one passenger
Length: 21 ft 5 in (6.53 m)
Wingspan: 29 ft 11 in (9.12 m)
Height: 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)
Wing area: 124 sq ft (11.5 m2)
Empty weight: 1,023 lb (464 kg)
Gross weight: 1,575 lb (714 kg)
Fuel capacity: 24 US gal (20 imp gal; 91 L)
Powerplant: 1 Ã— Menasco C4 inverted four-cylinder air-cooled inline-engine, 125 hp (93 kW)

Performance:
Maximum speed: 150 mph (240 km/h, 130 kn)
Cruise speed: 127 mph (204 km/h, 110 kn)
Stall speed: 42 mph (68 km/h, 36 kn) (with flaps)
Range: 350 mi (560 km, 300 nmi)
Service ceiling: 17,500 ft (5,300 m)
Rate of climb: 1,200 ft/min (6.1 m/s)

Notes:
This model is based on NC14985, an ST model which was upgraded to a D-4 engine later, making it an ST-A. It is simply a beautiful aircraft to look at (like all STs), and an absolute pleasure to fly.  It is very predictable and forgiving, especially on landing due to the wide stance of the main gear.  Visibility over the nose is good so ground maneuvers are relatively easy to handle, despite the size (properly managing the tailwheel lock will help).  Beware of the torque on takeoff, you'll need to use a decent amount of right rudder to counteract it.  Takeoff trim will prevent the tail from coming up too early, but once the speed is alive you'll need the tail up for directional awareness.  Flap isn't required on takeoff, but the first notch will usually shorten the run.  Climb out is around 65mph, with around 80 for best climb rate.  Approach is usually around 70-80, slowing to around 60 over the fence, and touchdown will be in the 50s.

This model has been built referencing the available type certificate data for both the Menasco D-4 engine and the airframe, as well as numerous other online sources for performance data and pilot reports on handling.  The fuel consumption algorithm is custom and based on the Menasco performance data.

A few other flight model enhancements are in the works to further improve the accuracy and quality of life in the cockpit, but in the meantime, enjoy!

CREDITS
Much, much credit goes to Swingman for the orignal FS9 model on which this is based.  It is simply an outstanding 3d model with lots of included detail, especially considering it was built almost 10 years ago.  Also, thanks to XP member ArcticPilot for the 3d prop disc he built for the Baby Ace, which I have included here.
